# Java-GUI-Whiteboard-Application
## You are expected to implement a simple network whiteboard application with the following scenario:

  You need to create a whiteboard application. There 3 defined shapes come with your whiteboard app. These shapes are line, square, and circle. The teacher and students can connect to the system simultaneously. The teacher draws shapes and students can see each drawing to the whiteboard.

## Minimum Criteria:
  You are expected to design the game by using java. Below are the minimal criteria:
  
  - Proper object-oriented (OO) hierarchy (Use concepts of interfaces, abstract classes while designing OO hierarchy)
  - You need to create one classroom and only one teacher and one student can join this classroom simultaneously.
  - You need to use the mouse or key listeners
  - Minimal GUI elements (Minimal a button, a checkbox, and a text field)
  - You need to create an online whiteboard application. Two users (one teacher, one student) can join the classroom using same computers but different application.
  - The teacher must be select shapes from the menu bar.
  - When the teacher draws some shapes, you need to show a counter for how many shapes are drawn.
  - Students can click the “hand” button to rise a hand and the teacher can see this information.
  - You need to time information using GUI elements.
  - When time is over, you need to create basic animation to show “time is over” message for the lesson.
  - Graphics (Java 2D API usage while designing your graphical elements)
  - Create a jar file
  - You need to take attendance and store it in a file.
  These are the minimum criteria, you can use more than these. Your application should work without any errors, so don’t forget to run and check your application.
  
## Bonus:
  - During the lesson or end of the lesson, the teacher can click the “attendance” button to see the attendance list. (minimum criteria for 3 people groups)
  - Using multiple Threads
  - More than one student can connect to the system.
  - Creating a smooth online application.
  - The classroom has a chatbox. (minimum criteria for 3 people groups)

## Limitation:
  You cannot use third party libraries in your project.
